## Expression_Accessibility_changes.R

This script generates a stacked bar chart to visualize the relationship between differential gene expression and chromatin accessibility changes over a period of 3 days and 5 days of Doxycycline treatment that was used to induce reduced expression of ADA2B. The categories include genes with decreased accessibility and upregulation, decreased accessibility and downregulation, increased accessibility and downregulation, and increased accessibility and upregulation.

## Metaplots of ATAC_peaks for Differentially Expressed Genes.R

This script performs ATAC-seq data analysis to identify and visualize changes in chromatin accessibility associated with upregulated and downregulated genes under different treatment conditions. The script reads peak information, normalizes read counts to counts per million (CPM), categorizes genes based on log2 fold change, and generates plots to illustrate the normalized read coverage across genomic regions.
