## Expression_Accessibility_changes.R

This script generates a stacked bar chart to visualize the relationship between differential gene expression and chromatin accessibility changes over a period of 3 days and 5 days of Doxycycline treatment that was used to induce reduced expression of ADA2B. The categories include genes with decreased accessibility and upregulation, decreased accessibility and downregulation, increased accessibility and downregulation, and increased accessibility and upregulation.
